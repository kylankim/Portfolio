<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #008c00">Welcome to the Sewing Club</h2>

<p>The Sewing Club was started two years ago by the students in the high school sewing classes. All students in the club sew beautiful items that are for sale in the school book store. The students also sew clothing and home goods that are donated to local charities. Join us and see how much fun sewing can be.</p>

<p>The faculty sponsor for the club is Ms. Sally Johnson, the sewing classes teacher. Ms. Johnson has been sewing for 40 years.</p>
