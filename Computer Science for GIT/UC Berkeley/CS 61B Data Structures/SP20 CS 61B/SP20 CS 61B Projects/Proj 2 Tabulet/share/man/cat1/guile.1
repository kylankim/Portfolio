       GNU  Guile is an implementation of the Scheme programming language.  It
       extends the R5RS and R6RS language standards, providing additional fea-
       tures necessary for real-world use.

       Guile works well for interactive use, basic scripting, and extension of
       larger applications, as well as for stand-alone Scheme application  de-
       velopment.

       The gguuiillee executable itself provides a stand-alone interactive compiler
       and run-time for Scheme programs, both for interactive use and for exe-
       cuting Scheme scripts or programs.

       This manual page provides only brief instruction in invoking gguuiillee from
       the command line.  Please consult the Guile info documentation for more
       information, (type  iinnffoo ""((gguuiillee))IInnvvookkiinngg GGuuiillee"" at a command prompt).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --LL _D_I_R_E_C_T_O_R_Y
              Add _D_I_R_E_C_T_O_R_Y to the front of Guile's module load path.

       --ll _F_I_L_E
              Load Scheme source code from _F_I_L_E.

       --ee _F_U_N_C_T_I_O_N
              After  reading _S_C_R_I_P_T, apply _F_U_N_C_T_I_O_N to command-line arguments.
              Note that _F_U_N_C_T_I_O_N is evaluated, so, for example, ((@@ ((mmyy--mmoodduullee))
              mmyy--pprroocc)) is valid here.

       \\      The  "meta  switch",  used  to  work  around  limitations  in #!
              scripts.  See "The Meta Switch" in the texinfo documentation for
              more details.

       ----     Stop argument processing, and start gguuiillee in interactive mode.

       --cc _E_X_P_R
              Stop  argument processing, and evaluate _E_X_P_R as a Scheme expres-
              sion.

       --ss _S_C_R_I_P_T_-_F_I_L_E
              Load Scheme source from _S_C_R_I_P_T_-_F_I_L_E and  execute  as  a  script.
              Note  that  in many cases it is not necessary to use --ss; one may
              invoke gguuiillee simply as gguuiillee _S_C_R_I_P_T_-_F_I_L_E _A_R_G_._._.

       --ddss    Carry out --ss _S_C_R_I_P_T at this point in the option sequence.   Note
              that this argument must be used in conjunction with --ss.

       ----ddeebbuugg
              Start  gguuiillee with the debugging VM.  By default, debugging is on
              when gguuiillee is invoked interactively; it is off otherwise.

       ----nnoo--ddeebbuugg
              Start gguuiillee without the debugging VM, even if gguuiillee is being run
              interactively.

       ----aauuttoo--ccoommppiillee
              Compile source files automatically (default behavior).

       ----nnoo--aauuttooccoommppiillee
              Disable automatic source file compilation.

       ----lliisstteenn[=_P]
              Listen on a port or socket for remote REPL connections.  See the
              manual for more details.

       ----uussee--ssrrffii=_N_,_M...
              Load SRFI extensions _N, _M, etc.  For example,
               ----uussee--ssrrffii=_8_,_1_3.

       --xx _E_X_T_E_N_S_I_O_N
              Add _E_X_T_E_N_S_I_O_N to the gguuiillee load extension list.

       --hh, ----hheellpp
              Describe command-line options and exit.

       --vv, ----vveerrssiioonn
              Display guile version and exit.

       --qq     In interactive mode, suppress loading the user's  initialization
              file, _~_/_._g_u_i_l_e_.

       GGUUIILLEE__LLOOAADD__PPAATTHH
              If $GGUUIILLEE__LLOOAADD__PPAATTHH is set before gguuiillee is started, its value is
              used to augment the path to search for Scheme files  when  load-
              ing.   It should be a colon-separated list of directories, which
              will be prefixed to the default %%llooaadd--ppaatthh..

       GGUUIILLEE__LLOOAADD__CCOOMMPPIILLEEDD__PPAATTHH
              If $GGUUIILLEE__LLOOAADD__CCOOMMPPIILLEEDD__PPAATTHH is set before gguuiillee is started, its
              value  is used to augment the path to search for compiled Scheme
              files (.go files) when loading.  It should be a  colon-separated
              list  of  directories,  which  will  be  prefixed to the default
              %%llooaadd--ccoommppiilleedd--ppaatthh..

       _~_/_._g_u_i_l_e
              A Guile script that is executed before any other processing  oc-
              curs.  For example, the following _._g_u_i_l_e activates guile's read-
              line interface:

                ((uussee--mmoodduulleess ((iiccee--99 rreeaaddlliinnee))))

       The full documentation for Guile is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If
       the  iinnffoo  and  gguuiillee programs are properly installed at your site, the
       command

              iinnffoo gguuiillee

       should give you access to the complete manual.

       http://www.schemers.org provides a general introduction to  the  Scheme
       language.

RREEPPOORRTTIINNGG BBUUGGSS
       There  is  a  mailing list, bug-guile@gnu.org, for reporting Guile bugs
       and fixes.  But before reporting something as a bug, please try  to  be
       sure  that  it  really is a bug, not a misunderstanding or a deliberate
       feature.  We ask you to read the  section  ``Reporting  Bugs''  in  the
       Guile  reference  manual  (or Info system) for hints on how and when to
       report bugs.  Also, include the version number of  the  Guile  you  are
       running  in  every  bug report that you send in.  Bugs tend actually to
       get fixed if they can be isolated, so it is in your interest to  report
       them in such a way that they can be easily reproduced.
