       When GDB finds a symbol file, it scans the symbols in the file in order
       to construct an internal symbol table.  This lets most  GDB  operations
       work  quickly--at  the  cost  of a delay early on.  For large programs,
       this delay can be quite lengthy, so GDB provides a way to build an  in-
       dex, which speeds up startup.

       To  determine  whether  a  file contains such an index, use the command
       "readelf -S filename": the index is stored in a section named ".gdb_in-
       dex".  The index file can only be produced on systems which use ELF bi-
       naries and DWARF debug information (i.e., sections named ".debug_*").

       ggddbb--aadddd--iinnddeexx uses GDB and oobbjjdduummpp found in the PPAATTHH environment  vari-
       able.  If you want to use different versions of these programs, you can
       specify them through the GGDDBB and OOBBJJDDUUMMPP environment variables.

       See more in the GDB manual in node "Index Files" -- shell command "info
       -f gdb -n "Index Files"".

       The  full  documentation for GDB is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If
       the "info" and "gdb" programs and GDB's Texinfo documentation are prop-
       erly installed at your site, the command

               info gdb

       should give you access to the complete manual.
