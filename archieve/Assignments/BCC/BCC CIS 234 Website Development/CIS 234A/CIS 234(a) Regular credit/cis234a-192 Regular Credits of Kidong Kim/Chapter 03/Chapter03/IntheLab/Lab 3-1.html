<p>It is time for our annual recycling drive! Recycling means taking a product or material at the end of its useful life and making it a usable raw material to make another product. We have been very successful with paper and plastic products. Last year, we recycled more items than our previous three years. Let's try to do it again this year. We will have adinner for everyone involved with the recycle drive on Satureday night. We hope to see you all there!</p>

<h2>About recycling</h2>
<p>Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions. Recycling can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, thereby reducing: energy usage, air pollution (from incineration), and water pollution (from landfilling).<p>

<a id="When"></a>
<h2>When</h2>
<p>ALL THE TIME! As a responsible inhabitant of this planet, you can do your part and recycle whenever possible.</p>
